# diff-patch

## Introduction

diff-patch is a library that exposes two functions, `diff` and `patch`.

The `diff` function takes two objects and deep compares them, returning an object that represents the difference between the two.

The `patch` function takes an object and a diff object and applies the diff to the object, returning a new object.
